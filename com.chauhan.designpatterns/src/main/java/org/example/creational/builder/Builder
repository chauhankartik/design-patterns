BUILDER PATTERN

Where to Apply?
    * Lot of optional fields while creating an object ? Go for builder
    * Big constructor parameter list ? Multiple small constructor ? Bad idea. 2^n constructors
    * Step by step object creation process

How to Apply ?
    * Single constructor taking a builder as a parameter
    * Builder class will have all parameters of parent class
    * setter methods will set a field and return builder
    * Builder can be interface/abstract
    * build(this) will return final object of parent from builder
    * Director will be responsible for order to invocation of setter methods of builder
