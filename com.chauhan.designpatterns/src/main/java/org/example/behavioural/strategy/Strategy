Strategy Pattern

Identifier:
    * Code duplication at children of same level (e.g. Sports vehicle and offroad vehicle needs same code/strategy to drive)

Implementation rule:
    * Parent class methods to be segregated out to a interface (strategy interface)
    * strategy interface to have concrete implementations
    * parent class uses Strategy interface as dependency inversion (constructor injection) e.g. Vehicle has-a drive strategy
    * Extending classes to select strategy/algorithm of choice
    * Final method to be invoked by parent class method on DI interface member
